					I. General Statement
				</span>{" "}
				: PRIVACY is a word that conjures up strong convictions and an emotional
				reaction from many of us. In the modern world, however, wondrous forms
				of electronic communication render the protection of privacy interests
				much more difficult. We in the university community are not immune from
				the lure of convenience and speed when we utilize our information
				technology and electronic communication tools. It is, of course, part of
				our mission to share knowledge and to collaborate within our academic
				community. In doing so, however, we must recognize that these modern
				devices are never completely secure. It is a fact of life that all
				computer systems and communication systems are the subject of constant
				probing by outsiders ranging from the curious to the criminal. The
				University of Denver will endeavor to take reasonable precautions to
				maintain privacy and security within the sphere of operations. The
				University cannot guarantee that these efforts will always be successful
				and, therefore, users must assume the risk of a breach of University
				privacy and security systems. Individuals are advised to be discreet and
				cautious in their use of our systems. The University of Denver Privacy
				Guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified in the
				discretion of the University. These changes will be posted on this site.
				If you are accessing this site from the European Economic Area, please
				see the European Privacy Notice here. <br />

					II. Personal Information :
				</span>{" "}
				The University of Denver recognizes and respects the importance of
				confidentiality and security of personal information in this
				increasingly open electronic age. The University does not intend to
				sell, swap, rent, or otherwise disclose for commercial purposes, outside
				the scope of ordinary University functions, your name, mailing address,
				telephone number, e-mail address, or other information you provide.
				While the University makes reasonable efforts to protect information
				provided to us, we cannot guarantee that this information will remain
				secure and are not responsible for any loss or theft. When an individual
				is connected to the University of Denver network or uses a
				University-owned computer, or other University-owned equipment, he/she
				agrees to abide by the rules and regulations of the University (see the
				University Acceptable Use Policy incorporated herein by this reference).
				While the University of Denver respects the desire and need for privacy
				in this setting, the University reserves the right, at all times, to
				search any and all hardware or software owned by the University, or
				connected to the University network, for the purposes of preventing or
				investigating improper or illegal use of University systems, or
				preventing or investigating system problems or efficiencies. In the
				course of an individual's involvement with the University community,
				software or third party systems that are used may require the individual
				to divulge private or personal information. The University is not
				responsible for the content, use or privacy of this information. <br />
				<span style={{ fontWeight: "700", fontSize: "20px" }}>
					III. University Website(s){" "}
				</span>{" "}
				: When users visit the University of Denver website(s), the webmaster
				collects information concerning their Internet connection, which pages
				they visit on the site, the Internet Protocol Number (IP) from which
				they accessed du.edu, and other general information about their visit to
				the website. (Information associated with an individual IP Number may be
				used for internal diagnostics and investigation of misconduct or
				security issues.) The collection of this information is intended to help
				the University deliver efficient and useful service and it may be used
				to analyze trends, create summary statistics for determining technical
				design specifications, and to otherwise aid in monitoring system
				performance. Such information is stored on a temporary basis and the
				University will exercise reasonable care to release it only if legally
				mandated by law enforcement investigators, required by court
				proceedings, or it is deemed necessary to internal investigations of
				violations of University rules and regulations. The University does not
				intend to sell, swap, rent, or otherwise disclose for commercial
				purposes, information regarding the behavior, habits, or demographics of
				those who visit University controlled websites. Certain parts of the
				University website(s) may require tracking techniques to follow the
				user's progress through courses, materials or programs or to verify
				information acquired from other sources. The University provides links
				to websites outside the du.edu network and is not responsible for the
				content or privacy policies of any website to which it may link. <br />{" "}
				<span style={{ fontWeight: "700", fontSize: "20px" }}>IV. Email </span>{" "}
				: The University does not intend to monitor the contents of e-mail sent
				to or from University servers, except to identify and correct problems
				with E-mail delivery or receipt, to work with email system problems, or
				to deal with misconduct or security issues. Electronic logs of who sends
				and receives e-mail through University servers are maintained for a
				short period of time. This information may be used to analyze trends,
				create summary statistics for internal planning purposes, and to
				otherwise aid in maintaining system performance and security. E-mail
				related information is stored on a temporary basis and may only be
				released if legally mandated by law enforcement investigators, required
				by court proceedings, or it is deemed necessary to internal
				investigations of violations of University rules and regulations. The
				names and e-mail addresses of University of Denver students, faculty,
				and staff are available in a searchable index. An individual may opt out
				of this index and have his/her name removed by contacting the Digital
				Team at andhrauniversity.edu.in . <br />{" "}
